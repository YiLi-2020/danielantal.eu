      <description>A very important part of my work is to pre-process data, and integrate various data tables into tidy, comprehensive data tables or databases. This is particularly difficult but rewarding when I work with statistics on sub-national, regional level. While country borders are very rarely change in the world, regional boundaries are changing on average every three years withing the European Union. Putting together data with 2010, 2013, 2017 and the forthcoming 2021 regional boundaries is a very difficult task.</description>

      <description>The fragmentation of the music business into microenterprises and freelance carriers make the work of a musician very complex. Most musicians do not only fulfill the artistic role of a performer, composer, lyricist or composer. In most cases, artists perform two artistic roles, but it is equally frequent that they perform a different, but still music related engineering, educator or managerial role. Given that that average size of creative enterprises in Europe is less than two people, musicians are forced to do several very different things.</description>

      <description>I have been creating market reports for 20 years, mainly in emerging markets where data is scarce and often has little history.
Starting as a junior consultant, I learned a lot about data acquisition. Later I held a &amp;lsquo;strategic information management&amp;rsquo; position in the Ministry of Economy and Transport in Hungary with oversight on the national statistical data collection. As a senior consultant and a former lecture, I used to train junior colleagues and journalists on data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Eurpoean Comparison: How Many People Ever Pay For Music, Film or Software</title>

      <description>In our recent private copying reports we compiled European survey data relevant to analysis. In Europe, there is a big difference between the use of electronic entertainment devices in richer and poorer countries. Nevertheless, the real difference is between the number of people who sometimes and who never pay for downloaded music, films and software.
In some countries of Europe, less then 10 percent of the population ever pays for the content that is loaded to their computers, smartphones and tablets.</description>

      <title>Changing Musician Career Paths</title>

      <description>In the 20th century the first career step was to get on stage and create a credible live performance. After several years on the stage musician’s got a recording contract, and usually even later they registered their first composition. The recording stream was the most important revenue source. The making of a record was expensive and offered considerable royalties or advances.
In the 21st century the live music stream is far more important than the recordings.</description>
