      <description>Private copying after 60 years remains a very important way of spreading recorded music, books and audiovisual works, and a very important source of revenue for artists, composers, writers, film writers and performers if managed properly. According to our research, the value of private copying is far bigger these days than when most CEE private copying remuneration mechanisms were set up.
While the new DSM Directive is not addressing these issues, it is aiming to re-arrange the power balance between users and rightsholders of certain unlicensed, or not fully-licensed and compensated uses.</description>

      <description>I am going to present the Hungarian results from our regional Central European Music Industry Report, and reflect on current challenges with promoting music in digital streaming and changes due to the new DSM directive. We will discuss some projects, including market development projects for the non-EU Balkans countries.
I would like to provide an opportunity on BUSH to give personal feedback to the artists and professionals who gave their personal details in our annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey from Hungary, or anywhere else in the region if they make it to BUSH.</description>

      <description>At a very early stage of my career I specialized in regulated prices and acquired a second degree in Economic Regulation and Competition Policy. As an advisor to the minister, I set up a regulatory framework with new regulation for Hungarian freight railways. As a regulator or as a consultant to the authority I participated in price reviews. As a consultant to regulated industries, I helped making legally allowed pricing decisions or helped to challenge regulatory decisions.</description>
